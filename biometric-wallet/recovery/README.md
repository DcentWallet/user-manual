# Recovering your wallet

## Before you begin <a href="#before-start" id="before-start"></a>

When a new Biometric Wallet is purchased or the device you've been using is reset to factory, you can recover your existing wallet.&#x20;

Your existing wallet can be recovered by entering all 24 words written down on the Recovery Card which was generated when you first performed the Initial Setup.&#x20;

### Recovering wallet after deleting data on D'CENT device&#x20;

To perform wallet recovery, you must first [reset the Biometric Wallet through "**Device Wipe**" menu](../setting-menu/#device-wipe). Once the device has been reset to the factory condition, follow the instructions from the section below to recover your wallet.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**"Device Wipe"** will delete all data inside your Biometric Wallet. Before you decide to wipe your device, make sure to check that you have your Recovery Card.
{% endhint %}

## Step-2 : Register PIN & Fingerprint

To protect accessing your wallet, register a new PIN and your fingerprint.

### Register a new PIN (4 to 8 digits)

Use **∧**(Up, increase number value) or **∨**(Down, decrease number value) button to input your PIN. Pressing the OK button on the hardware wallet will confirm the input.

When you have entered 4 digits, you will see '**OK'** text on the screen. If you wish to set your PIN to 4-digits long, then press the OK button on the hardware wallet.&#x20;

If you wish to set the PIN to a longer digit, you can change the ('**OK**' text) value on the screen by pressing the Up or Down button. **Your PIN can be set to 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 digits long**.   &#x20;

If you ever see a screen with a warning on '**Security level is low**', this means the PIN you have entered is a weak password. If you wish to use such a PIN, press the 'OK' button on the hardware wallet to continue.&#x20;

### Verify your &#xD;PIN

Re-enter the same PIN you have set in the previous step to verify for correctness.

&#x20;※ If the PIN numbers do not match, you will have to restart the PIN registration.

{% hint style="info" %}
After setting up your cold wallet, you can change the PIN value from the [Setting](../setting-menu/) menu.
{% endhint %}

### Register Fingerprint

1\) To register your fingerprint, touch your finger on the sensor to scan.

Fingerprint sensor is located in the middle of where the navigational buttons are located. \

※ If the fingerprint does not match, you will have to restart the Fingerprint registration..

※ If re-registering fingerprint, try using a different finger instead.

※ If unable to register your fingerprint for any reason, you will be given an option to skip the fingerprint registration. Fingerprint can be registered from the [Setting](../setting-menu/) menu at a later time.

※ If fingerprint verification fails, your fingerprint will not be saved.

## Step-3 : enter the recovery words <a href="#id-3" id="id-3"></a>
