# Wallet recovery using the mnemonic (recovery words) from the Ledger wallet

Both the Ledger wallet and the D'CENT wallet follow the same BIP standards for wallet recovery. However, each wallet service may have used a different wallet derivation path to generate a private key for each type of digital asset that each wallet service currently supports.

Below is a screenshot that compares the account addresses (ie: BSC & ETH) between the Ledger wallet and D'CENT wallet. In this example, D'CENT wallet was recovered using the mnemonic code from the Ledger wallet. Notice how the addresses for the BSC and ETH accounts are the same because the wallet derivation paths are the same between these 2 wallet services.

## List of recovery-compatible assets

The wallet derivation paths for the following cryptocurrencies are **the same** between the Ledger wallet and the D'CENT wallet. **This means that using the Ledger's mnemonic code, the same accounts(private keys) can be generated on the D'CENT wallet.**

* Binance SC (BSC - BNB)
* Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
* Cosmos (ATOM)
* DASH (DASH)
* Dogecoin (DOGE)
* Ethereum (ETH)
