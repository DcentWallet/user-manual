# Recovering your wallet

## Before you begin <a id="before-start"></a>

When a new Biometric Wallet is purchased or the device you've been using is reset to factory, you can recover your existing wallet. 

Your existing wallet can be recovered by entering all 24 words written down on the Recovery Card which was generated when you first performed the Initial Setup. 

### Recovering wallet after deleting data on D'CENT device 

To perform wallet recovery, you must first [reset the Biometric Wallet through "**Device Wipe**" menu](setting-menu.md#device-wipe). Once the device has been reset to the factory condition, follow the instructions from the section below to recover your wallet.
