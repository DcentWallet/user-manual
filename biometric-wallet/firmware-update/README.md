## Before you update the firmware

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have your Mnemonic Code \(24 seeds/words\) for recovery
{% endhint %}

24 words were provided during the Initial Setup of your Biometric Wallet and you have written them down on the recovery card. Make sure you still have the recovery card.   
  
Unlike other products, your wallet will still remain safely intact inside the secure chip even after updating the firmware. This means that you don't need to recover your wallet every time you update the firmware as other products requires you to do.   
  
\(Keep your recovery card secured and ready just in case your Biometric Wallet is no longer accessible, possibly due to "brick"ed device or something went wrong during the update process.\)   

{% hint style="info" %}
After you update the firmware, you cannot roll-back to the previous version
{% endhint %}

To perform the firmware update, use the USB cable that came included inside the original D'CENT package. Firmware update will take approximately 10 minutes to complete. 

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended that the D'CENT mobile app is not running during the firmware update.
{% endhint %}
