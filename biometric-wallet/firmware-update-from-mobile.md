# Firmware Update (from mobile)

## Firmware update indicator

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Currently the mobile firmware update is only possible for the Android Phones.**&#x20;

Android users with an **OTG cable** can perform firmware update directly from their phone.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

When D'CENT adds support to a new blockchain network, a new firmware will be available for installation. Your mobile app will show an indication when a newer version of the firmware is released.

## Before you update the firmware

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure you have your Mnemonic Code (24 seeds/words) for recovery
{% endhint %}

24 words were provided during the Initial Setup of your Biometric Wallet and you have written them down on the recovery card. Make sure you still have the recovery card before you proceed with the firmware update. \
\
Unlike other products, your wallet will still remain safely intact inside the secure chip even after updating the firmware. This means that you don't need to recover your wallet every time you update the firmware as other products requires you to do.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
After you update the firmware, you cannot roll-back to the previous version
{% endhint %}

To perform the firmware update, it is recommended to use the original D'CENT OTG cable. Firmware update will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.&#x20;

## Updating the firmware from an Android phone
