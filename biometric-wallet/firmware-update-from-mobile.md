# Firmware Update (from mobile)

## Mobile Firmware update

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Currently the mobile firmware update is only possible for the Android Phones.**&#x20;

Android users with an **OTG cable** can perform firmware update directly from their phone.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### OTG cable

OTG cable is an adapter or cable-type device that can update the firmware of the Biometric wallet on an Android phone. Please use an OTG cable that is compatible with your Android phone or Biometric Wallet charging port.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to update the firmware, your OTG device must capable of data transfer.
{% endhint %}



If your Biometric Wallet's charging port is **Micro USB 5 PIN Type**, you can update using D'CENT Genuine OTG cable.

D'CENT Genuine OTG cable can be purchase from D'CENT official website.

## Before you update the firmware

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Make sure you have your Mnemonic Code (24 seeds/words) for recovery**
{% endhint %}

24 words were provided during the Initial Setup of your Biometric Wallet and you have written them down on the recovery card. Make sure you still have the recovery card before you proceed with the firmware update. \
\
Unlike other products, your wallet will still remain safely intact inside the secure chip even after updating the firmware. This means that you don't need to recover your wallet every time you update the firmware as other products requires you to do.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**After you update the firmware, you cannot roll-back to the previous version**
{% endhint %}

If you use a separate OTG device, it must be capable of data transfer.\
Firmware update will take approximately 5\~10 minutes to complete.&#x20;
