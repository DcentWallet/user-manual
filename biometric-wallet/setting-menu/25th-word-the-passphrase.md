# 25th Word (the Passphrase)

Do you remember? If anyone gets access to your mnemonic code (24 words), they can steal all of your cryptocurrencies by simply creating the exact same wallet. &#x20;

**The passphrase (25th word)** is an advanced security feature on the D’CENT Biometric hardware wallet. It adds an extra word to your existing mnemonic code (24 words) to create an entirely new set of private keys (accounts). This means that even if your mnemonic code is exposed to someone, that person cannot recreate the same wallet that you have without knowing the 25th word.

The passphrase is a word that is chosen by you and can be up to 8 characters consisting of numbers and or alphabets. **Please carefully choose your 25th Word which you can remember perfectly.**

{% hint style="danger" %}
**If you already have cryptocurrency assets in your wallet, please move all assets to another address, and then set the 25th word.**&#x20;

**Please note that completing the setting of the 25th word will replace it with a new private key, and the coin account you previously managed will not be confirmed.**
{% endhint %}

## How to set up the 25th word (Passphrase)

### Requirements

To use the passphrase feature, the D’CENT Biometric Wallet device must have a security chipset with **KSM version 1.1 or higher**. An older model of the Biometric wallet with the KSM version below the requirement does not support the passphrase feature.

KSM version can be checked from the **"Setting > Device Info"**
