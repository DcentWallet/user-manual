# Troubleshooting Guide (Android Bluetooth Error)

## How to solve issues relating to Bluetooth connection errors

For a seamless experience in connecting your phone with the hardware wallet, please check the following:

**1)** You have **enabled Bluetooth** on your Android Phone. Refer [**here**](https://userguide.dcentwallet.com/biometric-wallet/android-connect#android-phone-bluetooth-settings) for how to access the Bluetooth menu.

**2)** Make sure you are using the **Biometric Wallet mode** when using D'CENT App with your Biometric Wallet.

### Reset Android Bluetooth Settings

If your biometric wallet was previously connected but now fails to connect, or if the device is not detected in the "Search Device" popup after changing phones, **performing an Android Bluetooth settings reset** may help resolve the issue.
