Language support : English, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish

{% hint style="info" %}
After setting up your cold wallet, you can change the Language from the [Setting](setting-menu.md) menu.
{% endhint %}

### Select "Create Wallet"

To create a new wallet, select "Create Wallet" from the menu.

{% hint style="info" %}
Selecting "Create Wallet" will create a wallet from a new private key. \
If you wish to recover an existing wallet, please refer [here](recovery/).
{% endhint %}

## Step-2 : Register PIN & Fingerprint

To protect accessing your wallet, register a new PIN and your fingerprint. \
Firmware below v.2.5.5 only supports 4-digit PIN length.

### Register a new PIN (4 to 8 digits)

Use **∧**(Up, increase number value) or **∨**(Down, decrease number value) button to input your PIN. Pressing the OK button on the hardware wallet will confirm the input.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/1 (3).png>)

When you have entered 4 digits, you will see '**OK'** text on the screen. If you wish to set your PIN to 4-digits long, then press the OK button on the hardware wallet.&#x20;

If you wish to set the PIN to a longer digit, you can change the ('**OK**' text) value on the screen by pressing the Up or Down button. **Your PIN can be set to 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 digits long**.   &#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2 (4).png>)

If you ever see a screen with a warning on '**Security level is low**', this means the PIN you have entered is a weak password. If you wish to use such a PIN, press the 'OK' button on the hardware wallet to continue.&#x20;

### Verify your &#xD;PIN

Re-enter the same PIN you have set in the previous step to verify for correctness.

&#x20;※ If the PIN numbers do not match, you will have to restart the PIN registration.

{% hint style="info" %}
After setting up your cold wallet, you can change the PIN value from the Biometric Wallet [Setting](setting-menu.md) menu.
{% endhint %}

### Register Fingerprint&#xD;

1\) To register your fingerprint, touch your finger on the sensor to scan.

Fingerprint sensor is located in the middle of where the navigational buttons are located. \
Check the location of [fingerprint sensor](setting-up.md#before-start).

2\) Slightly change the angular positioning of the same finger when scanning and repeat until 100% (8 correct scans) is reached.

### Verify Fingerprint

Scan your fingerprint one last time to verify registered fingerprint.&#x20;

※ If the fingerprint does not match, you will have to restart the Fingerprint registration..

※ If re-registering fingerprint, try using a different finger instead.

※ If unable to register your fingerprint for any reason, you will be given an option to skip the fingerprint registration. Fingerprint can be registered from the [Setting](setting-menu.md#enroll-finger) menu at a later time.

※ If fingerprint verification fails, your fingerprint will not be saved.

## Step-3 : Write down the recovery seeds

### Before you begin - What are recovery seeds(Mnemonic code)?

Recovery seeds are the codes that you use to recover your wallet.

If your D'CENT Cold Wallet is ever lost, stolen, damage, or wiped and you no longer have any access to your wallet, **using recovery seeds is the only method of recovering your existing wallet**.

> **You MUST write down all the recovery seeds on the Recovery Card and keep it secured in a safe place.**>

Recovery seeds required for recovering your existing wallet is shown only once during initial setup. If you lose your recovery card, there is nothing we can do to help you recover your funds. You are solely responsible to secure your recovery card in all events.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you lose your recovery card, there is no other way to recover your existing wallet and your funds will be lost.
{% endhint %}

### Write down the recovery seeds from the lists

1\) Press **OK** button only when you have fully understood the WARNING notice.

2\) Write down all the recovery seeds (words) shown on the screen of your cold wallet. Press OK button to see the next list of words.&#x20;

There are 6 lists with total of 24 words and each list has 4 words shown. Make sure you write them down correctly and in the exact same order as shown.

3\) When you have written down all 24 words, press OK button to continue.

### &#xD;Recovery Seeds Verification

You will be asked to take a simple quiz. From the 24 words listed, you will be asked to enter 2 randomly selected words to complete the verification.

{% hint style="success" %}
