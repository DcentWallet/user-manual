## Step-3 : Write down the recovery seeds

### Before you begin - What are recovery seeds\(Mnemonic code\)?

Recovery seeds are the codes that you use to recover your wallet.

If your D'CENT Cold Wallet is ever lost, stolen, damage, or wiped and you no longer have any access to your wallet, **using recovery seeds is the only method of recovering your existing wallet**.

> **You MUST write down all the recovery seeds on the Recovery Card and keep it secured in a safe place.**

Recovery seeds required for recovering your existing wallet is shown only once during initial setup. If you lose your recovery card, there is nothing we can do to help you recover your funds. You are solely responsible to secure your recovery card in all events.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you lose your recovery card, there is no other way to recover your existing wallet and your funds will be lost.
{% endhint %}

### Write down the recovery seeds from the lists

1\) Press **OK** button only when you have fully understood the WARNING notice.
