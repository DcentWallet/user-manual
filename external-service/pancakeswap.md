# How to use PancakeSwap

This is guidance on how to use PancakeSwap which is a DeFi service based on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Since dapp browser (Discovery tab) of D'CENT wallet supports Binance Smart Chain, you can use PancakeSwap service through D'CENT dapp browser.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Discovery is a browsing function that allows you to use a blockchain-based decentralized app (dapp) service. Since all dapp services (including PancakeSwap) are not operated by D'CENT, any inquiries that arise while using dapp services must be directed to each dapp service operator. In addition, there is a risk of financial loss when using the dapp service, and the user is responsible for all risks that may occur while using the service.**
