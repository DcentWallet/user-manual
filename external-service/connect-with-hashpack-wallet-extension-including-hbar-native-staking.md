## How to do native staking of Hbar via D’CENT Wallet?

Staking in crypto involves holding and locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a digital wallet to support the network’s operations. It helps secure the blockchain and validate transactions, and in return, participants earn rewards or additional tokens. In the case of Hedera Network, staking entails holding HBAR (the native cryptocurrency) and delegating it to a network node to help maintain consensus. Stakers receive HBAR rewards in proportion to their stake and play an important role in securing and governing the Hedera network.

For this, there are some requirements:

* Your D’CENT Wallet must be plugged to your computer
* You must already a HBAR account on your D’CENT Wallet linked to HashPack the way explained above
* You must have assets on your account to begin staking

Before starting the process, it is important to note that you will be staking your entire account, you can not stake just part of it. If you want to stake only part of your assets, you will need to create a second account and split your HBAR into two according to how much you would like to stake. You can easily create another account of HBAR following the exam same process you created the first one.

There is no minimum amount of HBAR to start staking. Staking is made by a period of 24 hours from midnight.

As long as you are staking your token, you cannot transfer them, you need to unstake them to be able to use your assets once again.

Get to know more about HBAR Staking via the official article: [https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/staking/staking](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/staking/staking)

1\. Let’s open the HashPack app. As you can see, there is a Stake tab. Click on it, then “Stake you HBAR”

2\. You will be able to choose the node you would like to stake in or just go with the default proposal. We are not recommending one option over the other to you. It is a personal choice. Once selected, make sure to understand and agree with the information displayed then confirm by clicking on Stake.
