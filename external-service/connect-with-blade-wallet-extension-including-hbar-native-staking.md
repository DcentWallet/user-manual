## How to do native staking of HBAR via D’CENT Wallet? <a href="#d16a" id="d16a"></a>

Staking is the process of locking up HBAR in order to participate in the Hedera network consensus. By staking HBAR, users can earn rewards and help to secure the network.

For this, there are some requirements:

* Your D’CENT Wallet must be plugged to your computer
* You must already a HBAR account on your D’CENT Wallet linked to Blade the way explained above
* You must have assets on your account to begin staking

Before starting the process, it is important to note that you will be staking your entire account, you can not stake just part of it. If you want to stake only a part of your assets, you will need to create a second account and split your HBAR into two according to how much you would like to stake.

There is no minimum amount of HBAR to start staking. Staking is made by a period of 24 hours from midnight. While your HBAR asset is being staked, you cannot transfer them until you unstake them.
