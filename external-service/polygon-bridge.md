# How to use Polygon Bridge

This is a guide for moving assets from the Ethereum Network to the Polygon Network using the D'CENT Wallet. The D'CENT Mobile App's dapp browser (Discovery Tab) supports both Ethereum and Polygon networks, this allows moving assets between the two networks through the dapp browser.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Discovery is a browsing function that allows you to use blockchain-based decentralized app (DApp) services. Since all dapp services (including Polygon Bridge) are not operated by D'CENT, you should seek assistance from each dapp service operator for any questions you may have while using the dapp service. Also, it is very important for users to understand that there is a risk of financial loss when using the dapp service, and the user is responsible for all risks that may occur while using the service.

## **How to receive a small amount of MATIC coin**

In the Ethereum network, the transactions fee is paid using the ETH coin. Similarly for the Polygon network, MATIC coin is used to pay for the transactions fee.

If you have just completed transferring the asset to the Polygon network, you don’t be able to do anything because you won’t have any MATIC coin. Polygon network is providing a small amount (0.001 MATIC coin) to support users from the following faucets:
