## Delete Card

**Starting from version 8.1.0 of the D'CENT mobile app**, a **"Delete Card"** menu is available for removing registered card wallets. This feature allows you to delete unused cold wallets directly within the mobile app for better wallet management.

Deleting the card from the app **does not delete any of the private keys associated to the wallet accounts** you have created. You can re-scan the card to register it again, **but you must manually re-add any previously used accounts** to recover assets.

When you tap the "Delete" button, you will be prompted to authenticate with either your **6-digit mobile app password or biometric verification** to proceed.
