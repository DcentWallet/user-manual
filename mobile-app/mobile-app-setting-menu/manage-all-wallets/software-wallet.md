## Using the App Wallet

You can start using the App Wallet by selecting **"Mobile App Wallet"** when you first launch the D'CENT mobile app after installation.

Alternatively, if you are already using a cold wallet (Biometric Wallet or Card Wallet), you can also add an App Wallet by going to **"Settings > Manage All Wallets"** and selecting **"Add App Wallet"**.

In the D'CENT mobile app, a message indicating the required for backup is displayed at the top of the **"My Wallet"** tab, when adding a cryptocurrency account, and in the **"Settings"** tab.

### Important Notes When Adding an Account

#### **Legacy Account Notice**

Starting from Mobile App version **v5.3.1**, for assets that use **Ethereum-format addresses** such as **Kaia**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **RSK**, the app has been updated to generate accounts that use the _same address format as Ethereum_ when creating a new account.

**Please refer to the guide below for more details.**

{% endcontent-ref %}

#### **If assets are not visible after recovering from an external wallet's mnemonic code**

If you restore a wallet using a mnemonic code from an external wallet but find that the address is different and assets are not visible, you may need to enable the **Custom Path Account** feature and manually add the corresponding **"Vendor Lock-In"** account.

For detailed instructions on **Vendor Lock-In accounts**, click [**here**](https://userguide.dcentwallet.com/mobile-app/create-account/how-to-add-a-custom-path-account#add-a-vendor-lock-in-account).
