# App Wallet (Software)

## Using the App Wallet

You can start using the App Wallet by selecting **"Mobile App Wallet"** when you first launch the D'CENT mobile app after installation.

Alternatively, if you are already using a cold wallet (Biometric Wallet or Card Wallet), you can also add an App Wallet by going to **"Settings > Manage All Wallets"** and selecting **"Add App Wallet"**.
