If you don't have a Backup Card, you will want to save this encrypted data in a safe place or send it to yourself in a message. You can recover this backup image onto a Backup Card at a later time. 

Make sure to remember the password you have set to encrypt the backup image. If you forget the password, you will not be able to recover your wallet.
