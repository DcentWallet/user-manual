# D'CENT Backup Card (Wallet Recovery)

## What is a D'CENT Backup Card?

One of the key conveniences of the D'CENT All-in-One Wallet is its unique backup method. Rather than using a traditional mnemonic code, the private key is backed up using state-of-the-art encryption technology, which securely transfers the private key to a spare Backup Card. This method is both easy to use and highly secure, giving users peace of mind that their assets are protected.

The Backup Card is a hardware wallet with no data inside the secure chipset and it is used for creating the exact same clone of your All-in-One Wallet.  &#x20;

**You&#x20;**<mark style="color:red;">**MUST**</mark>**&#x20;create a backup copy of the All-in-One Wallet before an unfortunate situation happens such as the All-in-One Wallet being stolen, lost, damaged, or card getting blocked.** In any one of these situations, all cryptocurrency assets will be lost forever if you did not create a backup copy of the All-in-One wallet.
