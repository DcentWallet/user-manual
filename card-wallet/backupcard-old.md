## What is a D'CENT Backup card?

D'CENT Backup Card is a hardware wallet with **no data** inside the security chip, which can be used to make a backup copy of your original card type wallet through secure encryption technology. This means that the data from your original card wallet is encrypted with the user's password and can be transferred to the Backup Card to create an exact same copy of your existing wallet.
