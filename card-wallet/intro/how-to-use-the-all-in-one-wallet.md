While using the All-in-One Wallet, you will be asked to enter the PIN of the hardware wallet for the following occasions:&#x20;

1\) To sign the transaction

2\) When changing the current PIN to a new PIN

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pin-block.png)

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">As a security measure, a total of 10 attempts are available to enter the correct PIN.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">The secure chipset on the All-in-One Wallet keeps count of how many authentication attempts have failed. If the incorrect PIN is entered consecutively 10 times, the secure chipset on the hardware wallet will be blocked permanently. This means that any cryptocurrency assets stored in the All-in-One Wallet will no longer be accessible and lost forever.</mark>
