# Connecting your wallet to a dApp site

When visiting a decentralized application service (dApp service or blockchain based service), the website will **usually detect** the decentralized wallet being used and **will automatically trigger** wallet connection request. In this case, simply click on 'Connect' button and your wallet gets connected to the website.

When visiting a dApp service, wallet connection may not be triggered by the website. In this case, you can simply press the "Connect Wallet" button from the website menu.

If a website shows D'CENT as a wallet option, click on the logo to connect to the website (dApp).

If a website does not show D'CENT, you can click on either **Metamask or Web3** from the list and your D'CENT Wallet will be connected to the website (dApp).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Web3 = D'CENT = Metamask**\
Selecting any one of these options from the website will connect D'CENT wallet to the service.
{% endhint %}
