## **Connect Wallet to a DApp Site**

When you access a decentralized application (DApp) site, the website typically detects the blockchain wallet in use and automatically triggers a connection request.\
At this point, review the account information being connected, then tap the **“Connect”** button to link your D'CENT wallet to the DApp site.

Wallet connection may not be automatically triggered when visiting a DApp site. In this case, you can manually connect your wallet by clicking the **"Connect"** or **"Connect Wallet"** button from the site’s menu. Then, choose **"D’CENT"** or **"WalletConnect"** from the wallet connection options to link your D’CENT wallet to the DApp site.
