# Using WalletConnect

D’CENT Mobile App has added support for **"WalletConnect"**. You can now connect and access your favorite DApps on PC or Mobile browser using D’CENT wallet addresses.

✅ Full list of DApps supporting WalletConnect can be found here: [https://walletconnect.org/apps](https://walletconnect.org/apps)

## What is WalletConnect?

WalletConnect is an open protocol for connecting DApps on your browser to mobile wallets using end-to-end encryption by scanning a QR code. This allows users to establish connections to websites (DApps) from a browser and carry out transactions securely from D’CENT Wallet without revealing any secret information to the internet.

You will need your [D’CENT Mobile App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kr.iotrust.dcent.wallet\&utm_source=dcentwallet\&utm_campaign=mobileapp) and PC to access the DApp website.

## Using DApps via D’CENT DApp browser (Discovery)

D’CENT Wallet has a built-in DApp browser, which supports connecting to DApps much easier by using **Web3 wallet (ie: D’CENT).** Advantage in using the built-in browser is that you only need to use a single application (D’CENT Wallet) to access a DApp service.

When accessing PoolTogether from the **Discovery tab**, a wallet connection request will be automatically triggered, allowing you to connect your **D'CENT Wallet**.

If the DApp service does not support the Web3 interface, you can select **"WalletConnect"** to establish connection to the DApp. Instructions are similar to the previous methods described in the sections above.
