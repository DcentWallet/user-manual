# Using Wallet Connect

D’CENT Mobile App has added support for [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/). You can now connect and access your favorite DApps on PC or Mobile browser using D’CENT wallet addresses.

✅ Full list of DApps supporting WalletConnect can be found here: [https://walletconnect.org/apps](https://walletconnect.org/apps)

### What is WalletConnect?

WalletConnect is an open protocol for connecting DApps on your browser to mobile wallets using end-to-end encryption by scanning a QR code. This allows users to establish connections to websites \(DApps\) from a browser and carry out transactions securely from D’CENT Wallet without revealing any secret information to the internet.

**Step 7\)** When you perform a transaction on the DApp service you are using, you will be prompted to confirm the transaction on the D’CENT Wallet.

### Using DApps via D’CENT DApp browser \(Discovery\)

D’CENT Wallet has a built-in DApp browser, which supports connecting to DApps much easier by using **Web3 wallet \(ie: D’CENT\).** Advantage in using the built-in browser is that you only need to use a single application \(D’CENT Wallet\) to access a DApp service.

If the DApp service does not support the Web3 interface, you can select WalletConnect to establish connection to the DApp. Instructions are similar to the previous methods described in the sections above.
