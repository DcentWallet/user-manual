# Switch DApp Browser Account

By clicking the **Network (üåê)** icon on the top right corner of the **"Discovery"** tab, you can change the account and blockchain network used in the DApp browser.

You can either select a different account that has already been added to the wallet from the list, or search and select the desired account and network using the search bar.
