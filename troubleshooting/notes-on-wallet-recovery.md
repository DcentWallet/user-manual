# Notes on Wallet Recovery - Legacy account

With the mobile app update to version v5.3.1, accounts created for Kaia (KAIA), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and RSK (Rootstock) now generate with the same address as the Ethereum account.

Therefore, if you have been using the D'CENT app wallet or biometric wallet before this update, you will need to **create a 'Legacy' account after wallet recovery to access your previously held assets**.

## How to Add a "Legacy" Account

**1)** If the newly created account does not include **"Legacy"** in its name, proceed with adding the Legacy account.

**2)** Tap the **"Add Account`+`"** button, then select the account labeled **"Legacy"** from the list (e.g., Kaia Legacy).

**3)** Once the process is complete, an account with **"Legacy"** in its name will be created, allowing you to access your previously held assets.

**4)** If an account without **"Legacy"** is displayed, tap the **"Hide Account"** button to remove the newly created account.
