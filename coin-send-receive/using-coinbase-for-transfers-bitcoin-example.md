The picture below is an example of how Coinbase displays your account address, for example Bitcoin.\
The upper portion is the Bitcoin address shown in QR code and just below it is the same address in hex format.\
\
You can switch to a different cryptocurrency account by making your selection from the '**Currency**' section.

3\) If the QR code is read correctly, you will see that the recipient address has been entered automatically. It is always a good practice to double check the recipient address and make sure it is the correct address that you want to send fund to.\
\
4\) Press '**Next**' button to continue.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the **'Next' button is disabled** while a red text message 'Address format is incorrect' is shown, this means that the address is incorrectly entered. Notice that there is extra '**bitcoin:**' text in the beginning of the address. If this ever happens, just delete the extra text and the 'Next' button will be enabled.
{% endhint %}

5\) Set the transaction fee first. Fee amount can be changed by using the slider button. If you set the fee to 'High', it is more likely that your transaction will be accepted with priority and processed faster by the blockchain network.

6\) Next, set the amount to Send. You can enter the number of cryptocurrency to send or enter the amount by the fiat value. If you intend to send the whole available amount, then just press the '**Max**' button.

7\) Press the '**Next**' button to continue.

8\) In the next screen, double check the transaction details of the recipient address and the sending amount. Press the '**Send**' button when details are correct.

10\) Once authenticated, your Send transaction will be broadcasted to the blockchain network.

11\) Go back to your Coinbase account and check that you have received the fund sent from your D'CENT Wallet.&#x20;

From Coinbase, you can check the history of Recent Transactions. If the status is showing as 'PENDING', this means that your fund is still being processed by the blockchain network to get more confirmations. To view the detailed transaction history, you can click '**View Transaction**', which will open a new window redirecting you to the block explorer where you can check the status.
