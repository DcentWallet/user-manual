# How to receive or send an NFT token

## Receiving an NFT token to D'CENT Wallet

Let’s see how to send NFTs from another wallet to D'CENT Wallet. In our example, we have NFTs using Metamask at Rarible, an NFT marketplace. At this time, the situation is where you want to send NFT to D'CENT Wallet. The process of transferring an NFT from other exchanges and wallets to D'CENT Wallet is similar.

**1.** Check the NFT you currently have. In this example, we have an NFT in the MetaMask wallet connected to the Rarible Marketplace. To transfer this NFT token to the D'CENT Wallet, click on  Transfer.

**2.** The MetaMask (or wallet that is currently linked to the service) screen will be triggered, and you will have to create a send transaction. After entering the address, set the fee and click OK. This will send the NFT transfer transaction to the blockchain network (Ethereum in the example).
