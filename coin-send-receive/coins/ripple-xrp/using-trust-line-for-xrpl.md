**4.** You can label your account or set it as default. Click ‘**Create**’ to add this Trust Line.

**5.** The Trust Line added should show up under the XRP account.

## **How to set (activate) Trust Line**

Remember that just adding a Trust Line does not mean you can receive the Trust Asset (IOUs) to this account. **You must first set (activate) the Trust Line before you can receive funds**.

**3.** Note that setting(activating) a Trust Line will **reserve 2 XRP** (at the time of writing). To activate the Trust Line, click on the ‘**OK**’ button.

**4.** When the Trust Line is activated, the account will display the address.

## How to disable a Trust Line <a href="#1a2e" id="1a2e"></a>

A Trust Line can be deactivated at any time, even if there is remaining funds in that account. However, the funds remaining in the deactivated Trust Line account will become non-transferable. The 2 XRP reserved from setting a Trust Line will become liquid again only if the Trust Line has no remaining balance. Therefore, before you deactivate a Trust Line, it is highly recommended to empty the account.

**👉 Disabling a Trust Line account will free up 2 XRP which was reserved (locked) in your XRPL account.**

**(4)** Read the message and Click on **‘Disable’**.

**(5)** Disabling a Trust Line will send a transaction to the XRPL blockchain network and a small transaction fee is required. Enter your password to sign this transaction. If you are using a Biometric wallet, you will sign from that device.

**(6)** Once the Trust Line gets disabled, you will see a message that shows “Trustline is not activated yet”.
