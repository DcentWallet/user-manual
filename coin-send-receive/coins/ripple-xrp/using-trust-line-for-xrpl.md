**4.** You can label your account or set it as default. Click '**Create'** to add this Trust Line account.

**5.** The Trust Line account added should show up under the XRP account.

### **How to set (activate) Trust Line**

Remember that just adding a Trust Line account does not mean you can receive the Trust Asset (IOUs) to this account. **You must first set (activate) the Trust Line before you can receive funds**.

**3.** Note that setting(activating) a Trust Line will **reserve 0.2 XRP** (at the time of writing). To activate the Trust Line, click on the '**OK'** button.

**4.** Activating a Trust Line will send a transaction to the XRPL blockchain network and a small transaction fee is required. Enter your password to sign this transaction. If you are using a Biometric wallet, you will sign from that device.

**5.** When the Trust Line is activated, the account will display the address.

## How to disable a Trust Line <a href="#id-1a2e" id="id-1a2e"></a>

A Trust Line can be deactivated at any time, even if there is remaining funds in that account. However, the funds remaining in the deactivated Trust Line account will become non-transferable. The 0.2 XRP reserved from setting a Trust Line will become liquid again only if the Trust Line has no remaining balance. Therefore, before you deactivate a Trust Line, it is highly recommended to empty the account.

**üëâ Disabling a Trust Line account will free up 0.2 XRP which was reserved (locked) in your XRPL account.**

**3.** Read the message and Click on '**Disable'.**
