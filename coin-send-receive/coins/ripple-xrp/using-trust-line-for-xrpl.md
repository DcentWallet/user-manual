# Using Trust Line for XRPL

This is an instruction guide on **how to add** a Trust Line account to your XRPL and **how to activate** it in order to receive the Trust Asset (IOU).&#x20;

## **How to add a Trust Line account**

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/트러스트라인-eng01.png)

1\) Click on the Add account **(+)** button and search for the name of the Trust Line account you’d like to add.

2\) For example, we will add Elysian (ELS). Search for **"ELS"** and click on the **Elysian (ELS) TrustLine** from the list.

3\) Select your XRP account to set it as the Fee Account. Click "**Next**" to continue.

4\) You can label your account or set it as default. Click "**Create"** to add this Trust Line account.

5\) The Trust Line account added should show up under the XRP account.

### **How to set (activate) Trust Line**

Remember that just adding a Trust Line account does not mean you can receive the Trust Asset (IOUs) to this account. **You must first set (activate) the Trust Line before you can receive funds**.

3\) Note that setting(activating) a Trust Line will **reserve 2 XRP** (at the time of writing). To activate the Trust Line, click on the **"OK"** button.

4\) Activating a Trust Line will send a transaction to the XRPL blockchain network and a small transaction fee is required. Enter your password to sign this transaction. If you are using a Biometric wallet, you will sign from that device.

5\) When the Trust Line is activated, the account will display the address.

## How to disable a Trust Line <a href="#1a2e" id="1a2e"></a>

A Trust Line can be deactivated at any time, even if there is remaining funds in that account. However, the funds remaining in the deactivated Trust Line account will become non-transferable. The 2 XRP reserved from setting a Trust Line will become liquid again only if the Trust Line has no remaining balance. Therefore, before you deactivate a Trust Line, it is highly recommended to empty the account.

**👉 Disabling a Trust Line account will free up 2 XRP which was reserved (locked) in your XRPL account.**

4\) Disabling a Trust Line will send a transaction to the XRPL blockchain network and a small transaction fee is required. Enter your password to sign this transaction. If you are using a Biometric wallet, you will sign from that device.

5\) Once the Trust Line gets disabled, you will see a message that shows **“Trustline is not activated yet”.**
