# How to use XRP account

## Ripple (XRP) account activation

If you have added your Ripple (XRP) wallet address for the first time, it is disabled. [Ripple's policy](https://xrpl.org/reserves.html) **requires a purchase or transfer of Ripple of 1 XRP or higher** to convert the Ripple wallet address to an activated state. Therefore, the corresponding 1 XRP will permanently lock-up at the corresponding wallet address.\
\
If a permanent lockup is made at the address of the Ripple wallet, it is assumed that only 99 XRP can be transferred, excluding the 1 XRP, which is the permanent lockup amount.

Depending on the exchange services, transferring fund to an inactive XLM account address may be restricted.&#x20;

## XRP Destination Tag

Users' ripple wallets assigned by the Exchanges use the same address. In other words, User # 1, User # 2, User # 3, all use the same ripple address. To distinguish a user's account from another user, the Exchange will assign a **Destination Tag** to the user's account, which is an uniquely identifiable number. \
\
**Therefore, when sending XRP to a recipient wallet address created from the Exchange, you MUST enter the Destination Tag so that the Exchange will complete the deposit to the recipient's wallet account**.
