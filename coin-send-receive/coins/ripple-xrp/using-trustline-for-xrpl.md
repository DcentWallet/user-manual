**1)** Click on the **"Add account`+` "**&#x62;utton and search for the name of the Trust Line account you‚Äôd like to add.

**4)** You can label your account or set it as default. Click **"Create"** to add this Trust Line account.

**5)** The Trust Line account added should show up under the XRP account.

### **How to set (activate) TrustLine**

Remember that just adding a Trust Line account does not mean you can receive the Trust Asset (IOUs) to this account. **You must first set (activate) the TrustLine before you can receive funds**.

**3)** Note that setting(activating) a TrustLine will **reserve 0.2 XRP** (at the time of writing). To activate the TrustLine, click on the **"OK"** button.

**4)** Activating a TrustLine will send a transaction to the XRPL blockchain network and a small transaction fee is required. Enter your password to sign this transaction. If you are using a Biometric wallet, you will sign from that device.

**5)** When the TrustLine is activated, the account will display the address.

## How to disable a TrustLine <a href="#id-1a2e" id="id-1a2e"></a>

A TrustLine can be deactivated at any time, even if there is remaining funds in that account. However, the funds remaining in the deactivated TrustLine account will become non-transferable. The 0.2 XRP reserved from setting a TrustLine will become liquid again only if the TrustLine has no remaining balance. Therefore, before you deactivate a TrustLine, it is highly recommended to empty the account.

**üëâ Disabling a TrustLine account will free up 0.2 XRP which was reserved (locked) in your XRPL account.**

**2)** Tap the **\[Ô∏ô] (More)** button in the top right corner and click on **"Disable Trustline"**.

**3)** Read the message and Click on **"Disable".**

**4)** Disabling a TrustLine will send a transaction to the XRPL blockchain network and a small transaction fee is required. Enter your password to sign this transaction. If you are using a Biometric wallet, you will sign from that device.

**5)** Once the TrustLine gets disabled, you will see a message that shows **‚ÄúTrustline is not activated yet‚Äù.**
