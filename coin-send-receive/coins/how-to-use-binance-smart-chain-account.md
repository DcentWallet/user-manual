[Binance Smart Chain](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/guides/bsc-intro.html) is an innovative solution to bring programmability and interoperability to Binance Chain. It relies on a system of 21 validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees. The Binance Smart Chain also supports EVM-compatible smart contracts and offers interoperability for Cross-chain transfer.
