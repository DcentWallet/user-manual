## Binance (BNB) Memo

The Binance wallet used by an exchange service uses a single address. In other words, all users of the exchange have the same address. To distinguish each user's account, the exchange service manages the user accounts by assigning a unique identification character (Memo) to each user. \
**Therefore, when sending BNB to a recipient wallet address created from the Exchange, you MUST enter the Memo so that the Exchange will complete the deposit to the recipient's wallet account.**
