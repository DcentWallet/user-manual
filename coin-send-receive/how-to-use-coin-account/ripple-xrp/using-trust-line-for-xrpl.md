**4.** You can label your account or set it as default. Click ‘**Create**’ to add this Trust Line.

**5.** The Trust Line added should show up under the XRP account.

### **How to set (activate) Trust Line**

Remember that just adding a Trust Line does not mean you can receive the Trust Asset (IOUs) to this account. **You must first set (activate) the Trust Line before you can receive funds**.

**4.** When the Trust Line is activated, the account will display the address.
