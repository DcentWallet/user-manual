# ERC721 Token (NFT)

The ERC721 token is also called NFT (Non-fungible Token) and NFT is a non-replaceable token. While each ERC20 token has the same value, the ERC721 token has a unique value for each token. \
\
In other words, it is impossible for the NFT to replace one token with another. \
\
ERC20 is issued for functions similar to currency or points. On the other hand, ERC721 is used in cases where each token has a unique value, such as a game item.
